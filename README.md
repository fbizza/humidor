# humidor
This project involves the creation of a smart humidor for cigar preservation. It utilizes an ESP32 development board and a DHT11 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity levels within the humidor. The recorded data is stored in a Firebase real-time database, allowing remote monitoring of environmental conditions. The humidor ensures optimal storage conditions for cigars by maintaining temperature and humidity within predefined ranges. Users can access real-time data via the web server or directly through the Firebase database interface.
